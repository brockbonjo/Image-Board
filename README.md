# Image-Board

Gamer: 27 
  Would like a private board for his Discord server.  That would only have the finest memes, trolls, and an area where people can 
discuss the status of their game or Discord server. Wants an admin to be able to give him an account once he has earned his place high
enouh in the team.  


Female 32:
  Doesn't want to have a Facebook, Instagram or other mainstream medias but would love to post personal photos and write comments, or 
even stories behind them. 

Grandma 75:
  Doesn't understand the complexities of Facebook, doesn't want her information stored anywhere.  This is a website one of her grandchildren
could send her a link to and she can see what is going on in their life.  

The point of the app is to foster a sense of community through people who have developed a close bond through another medium.  Then 
socialize and express themselves.  Especially for those who sometimes can not express their thoughts in person.
